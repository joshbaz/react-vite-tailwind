    "Overview": "Tuko Pamoja explores the geopolitical and geolinguistics of the 1870-1900 Great Lakes nations (kingdoms and chiefdoms) that became colonial Uganda. The documentary primarily constructs and deconstructs the history of colonial confrontation by interviewing historians, various cultural leaders, and opinion leaders in Uganda. Information about Uganda’s recent past is from interviews with historians (academic and non-academic), opinion leaders, senior citizens and youths from various communities. Guided by the oral tradition culture, the filmmaker (Cindy Magara) goes into the community to seek an in-depth understanding of the construction of cultural identity/ethnicity and how they relate or fit in the larger Uganda (and, by extension East Africa) that is seen to have closely linked yet diverse peoples.",
